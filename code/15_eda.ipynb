    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is summarised in the name itself, it is an approach to data analysis where the goal is the exploration of the data and not necessarily hypothesis/model testing, although this can happen at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikepedia, along with all of its cited sources,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) has a great definition which in turn was derived from the work of late John Tukey, a well-known statistician who is considered the creator of EDA as a concept and approach to data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.\n",

    "Characteristics of EDA\n",
    "- It allows us to spot further inconsistencies within the data after the preparation stage\n",
    "- It helps us ask questions that expose facts about the data we have\n",
    "- It allows us to see complex interactions within the data\n",
    "- The visualisations at this stage are not necessarily meant to be publication-ready but rather quick and dirty constructs to asnwer questions from a different perspectives"
